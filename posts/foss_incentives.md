# A solution to incentive problem in FOSS

The [xz/liblzma security incident](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39865810) brought to the spotlight the incentive problem in Free and Open Source Software, that has existed since the beginning of the movement.

## Solution

I believe a possible solution is to create an organization that:
- is constantly looking for past, present and future contributions that are or could be valuable
- identifies who the consumers of such contributions are
- enforces the payment to producers

## Implementation
- @github seems to be in the right position for conceiving and creating such organization.
- The organization pays its bills by taking a fee from payments made to producers.
- The organization has an incentive to look for unrewarded developers whose work has a high
impact, either in the context of a small group of developers or in products used by millions.

- The organization employs experienced engineers to identify valuable contributions, supported
by automated systems.

## Usage
- Companies with attractive and challenging projects have an incentive to open them, since they can get contributions from a large pool of talent, and third-parties who benefit from the open source code
will be forced to pay.

## Further application
- One possible extension of such an organization is to pay producers of data used to train Machine Learning Models.
